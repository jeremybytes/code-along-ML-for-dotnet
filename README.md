# Code-Along: Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers

Coding along with the book [Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676) by Mathias Brandewinder.  

This code uses .NET 5 and a later version of F# than is in the book examples, so the code varies a bit from the book's code repository.
