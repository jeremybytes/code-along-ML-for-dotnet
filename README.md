# Code-Along: Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers

Coding along with the book [Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430267676) by Mathias Brandewinder.  

This code uses .NET 5 and a later version of F# than is in the book examples, so the code varies a bit from the book's code repository.

## Additional
**Chapter 1**  
I created a visualizer for the Chapter 1 sample.

**Chapter 3**  
The R NuGet package is .NET Framework. I could not find a way to get it to work with .NET 5. Most of my searches led to old articles. If you have a solution to get the RProvider working with .NET 5, drop me a line.  

*Aside: I went through chapter 3 samples back in 2015 (with .NET Framework) and was able to get the RProvider visualizer and map to work just fine.*

**Chapter 4**  
The FSharp.Charting NuGet package is .NET Framework. Unfortunately, I am abandoning further exploration on this path since FSharp.Charting is used in subsequent chapters.
